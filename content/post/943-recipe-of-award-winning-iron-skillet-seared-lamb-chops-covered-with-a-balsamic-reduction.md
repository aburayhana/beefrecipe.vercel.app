recipeinstructions:
- "Start with good quality, thick cut lamb chops.  Mix together the thyme, rosemary, basil, salt and pepper, and rub the mixture onto the chops, both sides, letting sit for a time to absorb the flavors."
- "Heat a heavy, well seasoned, cast iron skillet (if available), to nearly smoking temperature, for searing.  Add oil, followed by the lamb chops and begin to sear chops."
- "Cook chops to medium rare, which is about 3-4 minutes a side.  Or cook longer, if preferred."

- "With the same skillet on medium, add the chopped garlic and cook it just for a brief moment, stirring to keep from burning or overly browning."
- "Stir in balsamic vinegar, and cook briefly while scraping any bits of lamb from the skillet into the vinegar.  Stir in chicken broth.  Continue to cook, over medium-high heat, until the broth and vinegar mixture is reduced by at least half.  Then remove from heat and add the butter, stirring."
- "Set aside part of the reduction for individual servings and dipping.  Pour the remainder over the lamb chops on a platter and serve."
