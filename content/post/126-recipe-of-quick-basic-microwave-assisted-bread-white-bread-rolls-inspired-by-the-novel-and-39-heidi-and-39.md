recipeingredient:
- "20 grams Butter or margarine"
- "150 ml Milk"
- "1 tsp Dried yeast"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ★ ingredients in a heatproof container, and microwave for 30 seconds at 500w to melt the butter. Let it cool down to about body temperature. Add the yeast → sugar → salt → bread flour in that order, mixing well between additions."
- "When the dough is more less mixed, put in a plastic bag, and massage the bag lightly for about 30 seconds. Loosely twist the bag closed, and microwave at 200w for 30 seconds."
- "On a floured work surface, divide into 6 portions and round portion. With the seam side on the bottom, cover the dough balls with plastic wrap or a piece of plastic, and leave for 20 to 30 minutes."
- "When time is up, deflate the dough (press down on them) and form into any shape you like. For Heidi&#39;s white bread, just round the dough off again after deflating it..."
- "...put a rolling pin on top..."
- "...and press hard. (But not too hard.)"
- "It looks like this when pressed. Lift the dough up gently, and move to a baking sheet."
- "I formed all the dough into Heidi&#39;s White Bread. (The small one in the photo is the 7th roll.)"
- "Cover with plastic wrap or a piece of plastic (or a moistened and wrung out kitchen towel) and microwave for 30 seconds at 200w. You can skip this step, but the bread rises better if you do this."
- "In a warm room or using your oven&#39;s bread-rising setting, leave to rise again (2nd rising) for 30 minutes. Mist the dough to prevent it from drying out if you can."
- "For regular bread rolls, brush with an egg wash and bake at 180°C for 12 minutes. For Heidi&#39;s white bread rolls, dust the tops with sifted (use a tea strainer) bread flour, and bake at 150°C for 12 minutes."
- "How to prevent the bread from being raw inside Since the temperature inside the oven drops immediately when you open the door, preheat the oven to a high temperature. For the white rolls I preheat to 180°C."
- "I received some questions about stickiness. Since the moisture content of flour varies by the brand, if the dough is still sticky, add a little more flour."
