recipeingredient:
- " Bread dough"
- "160 grams Bread strong flour"
- "40 grams Cake flour"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "2 grams Salt"
- "3 grams Dry yeast"
- "140 grams Milk"
- "25 grams Margarine"
- " For baking"
- "1 Margarine"
- "1 Granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the strong bread flour and cake flour to a bowl. Add the yeast and sugar to the part of the bowl nearest to you and the salt at the back. Measure out the milk and margarine."
- "Heat the milk to body temperature (room temperature is also ok if it&#39;s summer). Add the milk to the mixture on top of the yeast and blend a little with your fingers. (Adjust the amount of milk if it looks like it is going to be too much or too little)."
- "When fully mixed, turn the dough out onto the work surface and knead with the palms of your hands (pressing in a forward motion). Knead for 10 minutes and when a thin film begins to form, add the margarine."
- "It won&#39;t combine well at first, but with a bit of effort everything should start to come together. Knead until the dough becomes a little glazed, gather into a large ball and placed it seam-down back in the bowl."
- "Cover the bowl in cling wrap and a damp cloth and prove inside an oven heated to 35℃ for 40 minutes The dough should double in size."
- "Take the dough out of the bowl and punch down. Split the dough into 8 equal pieces and form each piece into a ball. Cover with cling wrap or a bowl and leave to rest for 20 minutes (15 minutes if it&#39;s summer time)."
- "Once rested, roll the dough into oblong oval shapes whilst getting rid of any excess gas and roll it up away from you. Make sure they don&#39;t become too wide though."
- "Once rolled, firmly seal all of the seams and form into lemon shapes. Line them up on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, leaving plenty of space between each one."
- "Leave to prove for a second time in the oven for 30 minutes at 40℃."
- "Once proved, heat the oven up to 180℃. Whilst the oven is heating up, score each one, put some margarine on the top and sprinkle with plenty of sugar."
- "Bake for 17 minutes at 180℃ to finish."
