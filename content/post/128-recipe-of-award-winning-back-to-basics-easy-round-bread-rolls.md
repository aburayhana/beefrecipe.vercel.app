recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "10 grams Sugar"
- "4 grams Salt"
- "4 grams Instant dry yeast"
- "50 grams Milk"
- "80 grams Water"
- "10 grams Unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the sugar, salt and dry yeast to the bread flour and mix to combine. Attention! Make sure the salt and dry yeast don&#39;t touch directly inside the bowl."
- "Warm up the milk for 30 seconds in the microwave, and mix with the water."
- "Add the liquids to the bowl from step 1, and mix."
- "When the dough comes together, take it out onto a work surface, and push and fold for about 5 minutes."
- "Hit the dough on the work surface and fold it up, taking care not to cut or damage it. Turn 90 degrees and repeat. I&#39;m hitting the dough on the counter surface in this photo."
- "Here I&#39;m folding it up."
- "Repeat step 5 several times, then gently roll the dough up."
- "Repeat steps 5 and 7 for 5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, forming a smooth unbroken surface. Cover the dough with a bowl and leave for 3 to 5 minutes."
- "Spread the dough out in a bowl, and add the butter, which should be at room temperature. Massage the butter into the dough. Repeat steps 4, 5 and 7."
- "The kneading is done once the dough can be stretched out thinly and forms a smooth, shiny surface when rolled up."
- "Put the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise. If you can, float the bowl with the dough in 35°C water."
- "This is how it looks after the first raising (after about an hour at 30 °C)."
- "Press the dough lightly to deflate it. Taking care not to damage its surface, remove the dough out onto your counter. Cut into 12 pieces with a dough cutter, trying to make each piece have as much smooth surface as possible."
- "Deflate the pieces, and roll each one up, tucking the cut edges underneath. Turn 90 degrees and repeat."
- "Flip the dough ball over and pinch the seams together."
- "Here is how the dough balls look before the 2nd raising period. Flip the balls over again and line up on a baking sheet with the seams down. Cover with a moistened kitchen towel, and let rise a second time for about 60 minutes, until the buns have puffed up lightly."
- "This is how they look after the 2nd raising. (after 1 hour at 28°C)."
- "Bake in a preheated 200°C oven for 10 minutes. When they are golden brown, they&#39;re done!"
