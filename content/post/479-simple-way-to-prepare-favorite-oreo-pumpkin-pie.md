- "Holiday tip: I&#39;ve used orange halloween oreos and added additional crushed oreo &#34;dirt&#34; on top of the pie after it was cooled. I used cookies as spooky gravestones stuck in the muddy pie with RIP and BOO written in icing as this pie was for a Halloween party. Marshmallow ghosts and eyeball candy were some cute add ons as well."
