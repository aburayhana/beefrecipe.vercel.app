Boneless pork sirloin roasts cook fairly quickly, are easy to carve, and when done to the proper internal temperature, turn out tender, juicy, and full of flavor. This was a terrific roast recipe. I didn&#39;t have citrus but used Lawry&#39;s Montreal steak seasoning &amp; added worcestershire sauce to the mix. They don&#39;t have it all the time like the regular top sirloin steaks but every so often you can find the sirloin cap steaks at Costco.
