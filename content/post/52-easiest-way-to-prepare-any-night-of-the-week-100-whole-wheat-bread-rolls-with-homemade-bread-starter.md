recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Whole wheat flour finely milled"
- "180 ml Homemade natural leaven liquid"
- "1 tbsp Beet sugar cane sugar or your choice of sugar"
- "1 tsp Natural salt"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all of the ingredients in a bread machine, knead for about 10 minutes. Turn off the switch, gather the dough into a ball, put it in the bread maker, and reset the machine."
- "Put a damp towel over the bread maker and then, using the bread machine yeast-starter setting, slowly let the dough rise for 12 hours. Don&#39;t tightly wring out the towel."
- "When the dough rises 1.3 to 4 times in height, take it out, divide it into quarters, then roll each into a ball. Since the dough is firm, take care to make each surface smooth."
- "Make a deep cross cut into each rolls, arrange them on a baking tray, cover them with a tightly wrung damp cloth, then use the bread-rising setting of your oven for the second rising."
- "When the cuts start to open up, and the rolls have almost doubled in size, bake for 15-20 minutes at 200℃."
- "Feel free to use a seasonal yeast, or adjust the amount of liquid yeast to your liking. Unlike refined flours, the dough is firmer even after rising, but do not be concerned."
- "I recommend using finely milled whole wheat flour. The rolls will harden once cool, so warm them in a microwave or toaster."
