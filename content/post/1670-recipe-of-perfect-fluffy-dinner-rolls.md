- "A. Tangzhong - Mix flour and milk in a small pot and whisk until there is no lump. Heat this mixture over low heat, keep stirring until it thickens. Tangzhong is ready when the spoon used to stir leaves a visible trail all the way to the bottom of the pan or it turns into a thick paste. Turn off the heat and leave to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap to keep it from drying before adding to the bread dough. This tanzhong can be prepared the night before or few hours before baking."
- "B. Dough - Using a bread maker, pour scalded milk in a bread pan. Put tangzhong in followed by the rest of the ingredients in B in the exact order listed. Press ‘dough’ setting and leave until it beeps and stops. Move to step 5."
- "The same order of mixing the ingredients applied if using a stand mixer with dough hook attachment. Since this recipe uses INSTANT yeast, skip dissolving yeast in the liquid. Mix and knead until dough is elastic and not breaking if stretched. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl and cover with greased cling film. Leave to rise for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or until dough doubled in size. Proceed to step 5."
- "Transfer dough to a generously floured worktop. Dust dough and hands before working on the sticky dough. Punch down the dough and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each portion into ball. Place rolls on a lightly greased baking tray and cover with lightly greased plastic food wrap. Allow rolls to rise again in a warm area for 40 minutes or until they doubled in size. Meantime, preheat oven to 160°C - 170°C, depending the oven, adjust accordingly as appliance varies."
- "Remove wrap/cling film and brush tops of rolls with milk. Bake at 160°C - 170°C for 15-20 minutes or until rolls are lightly browned and hollow when tapped. Remove from the oven and brush tops with melted butter. Immediately, transfer rolls to a cooling rack. Leave to cool completely before storing."
