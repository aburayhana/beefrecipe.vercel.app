- "Take the 2 cans of corn and make a layer of corn over the hamburger in the cake tin."
- "Take the potatoes that taste the way you want and spread it on top of the corn. To make a layer that doesn&#39;t mix with the corn, pour the potatoes in clumps all over the corn and then carefully spread the potatoes to make the top layer."
- "Take the 2 cups of shredded cheese and layer the top of the potatoes."
- "Take the tin with the shepherds pie and put it in the oven at 325° for 20 minutes or longer if you want the potatoes browner."
