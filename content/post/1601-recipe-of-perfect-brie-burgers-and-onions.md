Brie Burger with Caramelized Onions and Sundried TomatoesModern Honey. I love experimenting with different types of veggie burgers - from bean burgers to quinoa to even broccoli burgers! - but I also love a good meat burger once in a while. While I can sometimes tolerate a beef burger, I MUCH prefer turkey burgers. The quick pickled onions is essential to the recipe, in my opinion, because the lamb has a strong, distinctive flavor and the brie is ooooey, goooey, rich.
