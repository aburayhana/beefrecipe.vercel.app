In a pan, heat the oil on medium heat. Add the mashed potatoes layer and spread evenly. Top with a little melted butter. Originally, cottage pie was a way of eking out a Sunday roast: after the cold cuts, and the ragout, the bones would go into a broth, and the I try one pie with unpeeled potatoes, as also recommended by Jane Grigson, but conclude that, sadly, a smooth mash partners better with the lumps of meat beneath. This comforting cottage pie is packed with the goodness of onions, carrots, chestnut mushrooms, tomatoes, and of course plenty of mince.
