- "Shape the dough into a circle with the cuts facing outwards (refer to the photo on the right). Pinch together the seam where the two opposite edges meet. I forgot to sprinkle black pepper on the bacon before I rolled up the dough, so after I brushed the surface with beaten egg, I decided to garnish with black pepper before baking."
