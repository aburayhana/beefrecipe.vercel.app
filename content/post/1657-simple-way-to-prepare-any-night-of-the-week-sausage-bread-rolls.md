- "This sausage bread can be made in bulk because it freezes so well. If you choose to freeze them, be sure to let the rolls to come to room temperature. Put them in a Ziploc or tightly sealed plastic bag and store in the freezer. You need to let them thaw before warming them. You can place them in the oven to warm up or microwave for a minute or two.  These bread rolls are perfect for breakfast, dinner or even snack time and it will definitely create a memorable taste for you and your family."
